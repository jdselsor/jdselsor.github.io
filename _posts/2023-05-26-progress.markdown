# Game Progress
It was kind of a long day at work today, but I was able to make some progress. I worked out a platformer controller using Pefeper's Making a Better Jump[^1] and Mokarrom Hossain's Double Jump[^2] and Coyote Jump[^3] videos. I also implmented a movable platformer using the Kids Can Code recipe[^4].

The next step will be doing some level design which should give me a good idea of mechanics.
