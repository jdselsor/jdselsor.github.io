# The Plan
To meet the goal of making a game for May, I have about 6 days from writing this post to finish. I also had to pick up some extra shifts at work, so realistically I will have about 3 days to finish. So with limited time, I’m making a Mario clone platformer. 

I’m using ![Kenny’s Pixel Platformer Series](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/series:Pixel%20Platformer) as the art assets and any other of Kenny’s assets for the UI and Audio. The goal is to make three levels and menus. The game will be short, probably only about 10 minutes, maybe less.

## Needed Features
For the game to be put on ![itch.io](http://itch.io) the game must have the following features:
- Double Jumping
- Object interaction (levels/doors/etc.)
- Moving platforms
- Collectible coins
- Persistent scoring system
  - The score will only be persistent while the game is loaded. The target application for the game is the browser.
- Level unlocking
  - A password unlock feels right and allow me to use Godot's UI system for more that just a menu and scoring system.

# Site Goals
As I said in my last post, the website has been going the best. The blog, for all purposes, is ready to go. So from now until the end of the month, nothing will be added to the website. That is going to be the next month's project, but I am going to list them.
- A togglable dark mode
- Better logo (for my Github and Itch)
- A navbar for projects, posts, about, etc.

# Next Month's Goal
Even if I fail this month’s goal of making a game. Next month's goals are going to be:
- Make a game
- Update site
- Update Itch page

# Random Thoughts
Besides working on the site and making a game I’ve been just working. In the time when I’ve been burnt out from work, I have been working on my Warhammer 40K Adeptus Mechanicus kill team. The test model went well, but any more progress will have to wait.

While I have been working on the game, models, and site, I have been watching Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury. I’m really enjoying it so far. It’s has been putting me into a sci-fi headspace for anything creative lately. So maybe next month’s game is going to be sci-fi themed.
