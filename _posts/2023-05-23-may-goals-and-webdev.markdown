This is about the 3rd time I have decided to update this blog site and tried to stick to a development goal. During May I'm trying to do two things. I am trying to make a game using Godot 4 and update this site.

So far the thing going the best is the site. I'm really digging Jekyll and after some trial and error, I figured it out enough to make some posts and get a list of the recent posts to display.

The game dev is not going so well. By far the largest problem I have is scope creep. When I started this goal thing I was going to make a turn-based RPG, but I overestimated by coding abilities and time. So I shifted to a pong clone, but that was just going to be a copy of ![Vimlark's Round and Back](https://vimlark.itch.io/around-back). I made a little progress on it to mess with Godot, but it's back to the drawing board.

The major issue I'm having is thinking of something small enough while being fun enough to play. I need it to be the greatest game in the world, but I need to be at least a little fun.

I thinking about making an action/puzzle platformer I've had in my head for a bit, but there goes the scope creep. So maybe make a "demo" the first few levels?

Another of my issues is a need for my code to be perfect, reusable, and modular. This is good in theory, but it gets in the way of doing.

I'm going to go back to the board and think of something.
